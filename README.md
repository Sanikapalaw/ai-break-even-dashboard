## 🔹 Project Overview

This project is an **AI-powered financial planning tool** that predicts your **break-even point** and classifies outcomes into:

- **Profit** 💰  
- **Loss** 📉  
- **Break-even** ⚖️  

Unlike traditional spreadsheets, this project leverages **Machine Learning and interactive dashboards** to deliver **real-time insights** for smarter decision-making.

**Key Objectives:**
- Support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in financial planning.  
- Automate break-even calculations and predictive analysis.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve profitability.

## 🔹 Problem Statement

Many businesses, especially SMEs, face challenges in **accurately analyzing their financial performance**:  

- Manual calculations are **time-consuming and error-prone**.  
- Static spreadsheets provide **no predictive insights**.  
- Scenario testing is inflexible, delaying decisions.  

This can lead to:  
- Misaligned pricing and sales strategies.  
- Poor cost management.  
- Uncertainty in achieving profitability.  

**Solution:**  
An **AI-driven interactive dashboard** that predicts financial outcomes and provides **real-time recommendations** to maximize profit and minimize loss.
